# EMF Explorer Badge

 Info about the EMF Explorer badge, created by Darcy Neal

This board was originally designed for workshops at outdoor hacker camps, hence the camping scenery. The aim is to provide an accessible tool that inspires people to get curious about the electronic frequencies that surrounds them. All of the components are chosen to be easy to assemble, with capacitor lead spacing and resistor colors different for each value.  Takes about 1 hour to assemble for any student (maybe faster, but 1 hour is a good baseline for planning).  
The inspiration for this design came from a desire to add more functionality to my ongoing badge designs, with something that was accessible and sparked curiosity in anyone participating. Some of the inspiration for the EMF amplifier design came from this [EMF amplifier workshop from etextile summer camp 2016](https://etextile-summercamp.org/2016/emf/), this [Make magazine article](https://makezine.com/projects/weekend-project-sample-weird-sounds-electromagnetic-fields), and this [Instructible article](https://www.instructables.com/Electromagnetic-Field-EMF-Detector-With-LM358/), to name a few.
